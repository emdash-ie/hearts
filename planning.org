#+TITLE: Planning
* Goals

High-level goals for the project.

** Hosted and playable on emdash.ie

It’d be nice to be able to show it off!

I think I’ll require room creation to be done first.

** Complete

(Just passing to add, I think)

** Better/nicer UI
** Other games
* Next

Things to do/add next, in descending order of priority

** Multiple rooms

At the moment there’s only one room: to allow more than one game at once it should be possible for people to create and join rooms.

** Passing

I think this is the last game rule that’s unimplemented: there’s currently no passing of cards.

** Playing with different numbers of people

The game currently requires four players, but three and five could be supported by removing some cards from the deck.
