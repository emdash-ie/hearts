#+title: Hearts

A server for playing games of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)][Hearts]], which allows multiplayer play over the web. It is in fairly early stages, and there is no hosted instance of the server available.

* Building / running

I typically build this using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)][nix]] and/or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(software)][cabal]].

I first run ~cabal2nix~ to generate a nix file from the project’s cabal file:

#+begin_src fish
  cabal2nix . > hearts.nix
#+end_src

What I do next depends on whether I’m building the program during development, or for deployment.

If during development, I enter a nix shell and use the ~cabal~ that that provides to run the program:

#+begin_src fish
  nix-shell

  [nix-shell]$ cabal run hearts-exe
#+end_src

If deploying, I use ~nix-build~:

#+begin_src fish
  nix-build release.nix
#+end_src

This command eventually prints out the path to the resulting binary, which I can invoke directly.
